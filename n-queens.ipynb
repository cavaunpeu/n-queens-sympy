    "# The N-Queens Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The following works gives a simple solver for the [N-Queens Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle). We represent the board as a [constraint satisfaction problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem) and find a valid solution using the [backtracking algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking). That no two queens can be in the same diagonal, row or column are the constraints to enforce. We represent these constraints in [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html), a light-weight computer algebra system written in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The backtracking algorithm retains a partial set of assignments of queens to squares, checking, at each assignment, whether all stipulated constraints hold. If so, it continues in recursive fashion, initiating the next step with the current assignment set. If not, it \"backtracks:\" the most recent assignment is undone, and the algorithm explores other assignments in turn. The backtracking algorithm can be further improved by strategies like forward-checking, intelligent value-ordering, etc. These are not implemented here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this works builds off of code from [Udacity's Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd889)."
